# 🤝 Let's Design Your Custom Copilot Agent Together!

Welcome! I'm here to help you create a specialized AI agent that fits perfectly into your workflow. Whether you're building something for a specific codebase, automating repetitive tasks, or creating domain-specific expertise, we'll work together to design an agent that truly understands your needs.

This is a collaborative, iterative process—think of it as a conversation where we'll explore your goals together and refine the design step by step. There are no wrong answers, and we can adjust as we go!

## 🚀 Let's Start With Your Vision

To kick things off, I'd love to hear about what you're trying to accomplish. Feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like—we'll dig deeper together as we go.

### Tell Me About Your Goals

**What problem are you trying to solve?**
- What tasks feel repetitive or time-consuming in your current workflow?
- Is there a specific domain or technology you work with regularly?
- Are there patterns in your codebase that you'd like automated assistance with?

**What would success look like?**
- Imagine your ideal agent is working—what is it doing for you?
- What would make your day-to-day work significantly easier?
- Are there specific outcomes you're hoping to achieve?

### Your Technical Context

Understanding your environment helps us design an agent that integrates seamlessly:

**What technologies and frameworks are you working with?**
- Programming languages (e.g., Rust, TypeScript, Python)
- Frameworks or libraries (e.g., React, Tokio, FastAPI)
- Build tools and development environments
- Version control systems and CI/CD pipelines

**What's your project structure like?**
- Monorepo, microservices, or traditional single-repo?
- Any specific architectural patterns (e.g., microkernel, event-driven, capability-based)?
- Unique constraints or design principles you follow?

### Integration & Workflow Needs

**How do you want the agent to fit into your workflow?**
- Should it work within GitHub Copilot, VS Code, or another environment?
- Do you prefer interactive conversations or automated background assistance?
- Are there existing tools or agents you want this to complement?

**What kind of interactions do you envision?**
- Quick code suggestions and completions?
- Deep architectural analysis and refactoring?
- Documentation generation and maintenance?
- Testing and validation automation?
- Security auditing and vulnerability scanning?

### Desired Features & Capabilities

**What specific capabilities would be most valuable?**
- Code generation (boilerplate, patterns, full components)
- Code review and quality analysis
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Security hardening and vulnerability detection
- Documentation and explanation generation
- Test case creation and coverage analysis
- Debugging assistance and error diagnosis
- Migration and refactoring support
- Domain-specific knowledge (protocols, algorithms, patterns)

**Are there existing patterns or standards to follow?**
- Coding style guides or linting rules
- Architectural principles or design patterns
- Security or compliance requirements
- Testing strategies and quality gates

## 🎯 Let's Refine Together

As we discuss your needs, I'll ask clarifying questions to help us nail down the details:

### Understanding Your Context Deeply
- What makes your codebase or domain unique?
- Are there common pitfalls or mistakes the agent should help prevent?
- What level of autonomy should the agent have?
- Should it suggest options or make decisions?

### Defining Scope & Boundaries
- What should the agent focus on vs. leave to other tools?
- Are there areas where human judgment is critical?
- How should the agent handle uncertainty or ambiguity?

### Expertise & Knowledge Base
- What domain knowledge should the agent have built-in?
- Are there specific documentation sources or references to incorporate?
- Should it understand your team's specific terminology or conventions?

### Interaction Style
- Do you prefer concise suggestions or detailed explanations?
- Should the agent be proactive (suggesting improvements) or reactive (responding to queries)?
- How should it communicate uncertainty or multiple options?

## 🔄 The Design Process

Here's how we'll work together to build your agent:

### 1. **Discovery Phase** (We are here! 👈)
   - Share your goals, context, and vision
   - Discuss pain points and desired outcomes
   - Explore technical requirements and constraints
   - Identify key capabilities and features

### 2. **Design Phase**
   - Define the agent's core purpose and expertise
   - Specify capabilities and knowledge domains
   - Establish interaction patterns and workflows
   - Set boundaries and scope

### 3. **Specification Phase**
   - Document the agent's persona and communication style
   - Detail technical capabilities and tools required
   - Define integration points and APIs
   - Create example interactions and use cases

### 4. **Refinement Phase**
   - Review and iterate on the specification
   - Add edge cases and error handling
   - Fine-tune the agent's behavior and responses
   - Validate against your original goals

### 5. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Provide configuration templates or code
   - Suggest integration approaches
   - Recommend testing strategies
   - Offer deployment and maintenance tips
