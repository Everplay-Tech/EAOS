Creation Prompts for the Remaining 9 Valar
Use these prompts in a new chat (with me or another LLM) to generate the full micro-package for each. Copy-paste exactly—they specify the structure to match ours (e.g., core.py with generate_nn/train_nn, utils.py for save/load, example_usage.py for testing).

For Oromë (Hunter, Optimizes Pursuit): "Build a complete Python micro-package named orome_valar, with init.py, core.py (including generate_nn and train_nn functions for creating/updating NNs with hunting-themed math like pursuit curves), utils.py for save/load, and example_usage.py for testing. Use NumPy and optional PyTorch for malleability. Make it standalone, testable with print outputs."

For Nienna (Sorrow, Optimizes Compassion): "Build a complete Python micro-package named nienna_valar, with init.py, core.py (including generate_nn and train_nn for compassion-themed math like empathy gradients), utils.py for save/load, and example_usage.py for testing. Use NumPy and optional PyTorch for malleability. Make it standalone, testable with print outputs."

For Irmo (Dreams, Optimizes Visions): "Build a complete Python micro-package named irmo_valar, with init.py, core.py (including generate_nn and train_nn for vision-themed math like dream sequence recurrence), utils.py for save/load, and example_usage.py for testing. Use NumPy and optional PyTorch for malleability. Make it standalone, testable with print outputs."

For Estë (Healing, Optimizes Restoration): "Build a complete Python micro-package named este_valar, with init.py, core.py (including generate_nn and train_nn for restoration-themed math like healing waves), utils.py for save/load, and example_usage.py for testing. Use NumPy and optional PyTorch for malleability. Make it standalone, testable with print outputs."

For Vairë (Weaving, Optimizes Fate Threads): "Build a complete Python micro-package named vaire_valar, with init.py, core.py (including generate_nn and train_nn for weaving-themed math like thread entanglements), utils.py for save/load, and example_usage.py for testing. Use NumPy and optional PyTorch for malleability. Make it standalone, testable with print outputs."

For Vána (Youth, Optimizes Renewal): "Build a complete Python micro-package named vana_valar, with init.py, core.py (including generate_nn and train_nn for renewal-themed math like growth cycles), utils.py for save/load, and example_usage.py for testing. Use NumPy and optional PyTorch for malleability. Make it standalone, testable with print outputs."

For Nessa (Dance, Optimizes Agility): "Build a complete Python micro-package named nessa_valar, with init.py, core.py (including generate_nn and train_nn for agility-themed math like dance rhythms), utils.py for save/load, and example_usage.py for testing. Use NumPy and optional PyTorch for malleability. Make it standalone, testable with print outputs."

For Tulkas (Strength, Optimizes Combat): "Build a complete Python micro-package named tulkas_valar, with init.py, core.py (including generate_nn and train_nn for combat-themed math like strength impacts), utils.py for save/load, and example_usage.py for testing. Use NumPy and optional PyTorch for malleability. Make it standalone, testable with print outputs."

For Melkor (Fallen, Optimizes Discord): "Build a complete Python micro-package named melkor_valar, with init.py, core.py (including generate_nn and train_nn for discord-themed math like chaotic disruptions), utils.py for save/load, and example_usage.py for testing. Use NumPy and optional PyTorch for malleability. Make it standalone, testable with print outputs."
