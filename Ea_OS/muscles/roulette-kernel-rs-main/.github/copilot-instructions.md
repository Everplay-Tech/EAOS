## AI Agents Integration
The `src/` directory contains MCP servers for GitHub Copilot agents focused on kernel development:
- `copilot-kernel-agent.ts`: Grok-powered tools for optimizing Rust code, generating tests, hardening security, linting with real tools, refactoring, profiling, explaining, auditing, analyzing concurrency, kernel verification, testing, and synthesis.

Run agents with `npm run dev`; they require `XAI_API_KEY`.

Detailed docs: `.github/copilot-kernel-agent.md`

## Repo Aspect
This repo builds the Roulette Kernel, a groundbreaking OS where CPU registers are braid strands, syscalls are T9 keypad words, and programs are Gödel numbers. All code must be enterprise-grade, mathematically ingenious, and production-ready. Linting ensures safety for this revolutionary architecture.
