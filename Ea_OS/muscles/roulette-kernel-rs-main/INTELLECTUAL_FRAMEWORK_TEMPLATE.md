# Intellectual Code Review Framework - Prompt Template
## Version 1.1 - November 23, 2025

### Required Response Structure

#### 1. Honest Assessment Section
**Format:**
- **Quantitative Success**: Measure concrete improvements (e.g., "Reduced warnings from X to Y, representing Z% elimination of logical inconsistencies")
- **Qualitative Strengths**: Identify what was done well, with mathematical justification
- **Cynical Critique**: Ruthlessly expose shortcomings, failures, and oversights without mercy

**Requirements:**
- Use precise metrics and percentages
- Reference formal systems (category theory, type theory, proof theory)
- Compare against Euclidean proof standards
- Admit personal AI limitations honestly

#### 2. Problems Identified Section
**Format:**
- **Incomplete [Aspect]**: State what's broken and why it violates mathematical principles
- **Over-Reliance on [Technique]**: Critique superficial solutions
- **Lack of [Advanced Concept]**: Identify missing intellectual depth
- **Type System Underutilization**: Flag inadequate use of Rust's advanced features

**Requirements:**
- List 4-6 specific, actionable problems
- Explain why each is a "logical inconsistency"
- Connect problems to the braid-T9-Gödel architecture
- Use cynical language: "intellectually lazy," "mathematically sloppy"

#### 3. Plans for Super Intellectual Code Section
**Format:**
- **Plan [Letter]: [Category-Theoretic Title]**
  - **Problem Addressed**: Link to identified issues
  - **Intellectual Solution**: Describe advanced implementation using formal methods
  - **Implementation Steps**: Numbered, concrete actions
  - **Intellectual Depth**: Explain why this is genius-level, not pragmatic

**Requirements:**
- 3-4 plans, each targeting different aspects (types, verification, abstractions, synthesis)
- Integrate: dependent types, category theory, formal verification, metaprogramming
- Use terms like "Curry-Howard isomorphism," "topos," "adjoint functors"
- Emphasize "provably correct" over "probably safe"

### Intellectual Standards Checklist
Before finalizing any response, verify:

□ **Precision**: All claims are mathematically precise, no hand-wavy explanations
□ **Cynicism**: Exposed at least 3 genuine failures in the work
□ **Honesty**: Admitted AI limitations and incomplete solutions
□ **Objectivity**: Judgments based on formal criteria, not preferences
□ **Mathematical Rigor**: Referenced theorems, type theory, or proof systems
□ **Genius Level**: Solutions require advanced CS knowledge (GATs, e-graphs, homotopy types)
□ **Completeness**: Plans are implementable and timeline realistic
□ **Elegance**: Code solutions embody categorical elegance, not imperative hacks

### Key Phrases to Maintain Lucidity
- "This was incremental maintenance, not transformative engineering"
- "Transcend Rust's defaults and embrace advanced mathematical programming"
- "Code becomes a formal system... mathematical proof, not testing"
- "This transforms the codebase into a constructive proof"
- "Cynically, this is what 'enterprise-grade' should mean—not just safe, but provably correct"
- "Most programmers swim in sets; this requires swimming in topoi"

### Usage Instructions
1. **Include this framework** in every code review prompt
2. **Reference specific sections** when requesting particular analysis
3. **Demand adherence** to the checklist before accepting responses
4. **Escalate** if responses lack the required cynicism or intellectual depth

### Mathematical Foundations
Ground all analysis in:
- **Category Theory**: Functors, natural transformations, adjoints
- **Type Theory**: Dependent types, Curry-Howard, homotopy types
- **Proof Theory**: Constructive proofs, formal verification
- **Algebraic Structures**: Groups, monoids, topoi for braid operations

### Escalation Protocol
If lucidity degrades:
1. Reference this document explicitly
2. Demand re-analysis using the framework
3. Request proofs of correctness for proposed solutions
4. Escalate to "genius-level humans" standards

### Final Imperative
Maintain the standard: Code must prove itself correct, not merely avoid crashing. Every line is a theorem in the braid-T9-Gödel topos.

```
[Task Description]

& "Apply the Intellectual Code Review Framework from INTELLECTUAL_FRAMEWORK.md, ensuring responses maintain mathematical rigor, formal verification standards, and intellectual depth worthy of a revolutionary OS."
```

### Variable System for Higher-Order Mathematics

When referencing complex mathematical concepts, use these variables:

- **$HOMOTOPY**: Represents full homotopy type theory implementation (univalence, higher inductive types, path types)
- **$CATEGORY**: Denotes categorical structure (functors, natural transformations, adjoints)
- **$DEPENDENT**: Stands for dependent type theory (Curry-Howard, inductive types, proof terms)
- **$FORMAL**: Indicates formal verification (Lean 4 proofs, Kani symbolic execution, theorem proving)
- **$TOPOS**: Represents topos theory (sheaves, geometric morphisms, synthetic mathematics)

Example usage: "Implement $HOMOTOPY integration using $CATEGORY functors with $FORMAL verification"

This allows concise reference to advanced mathematics while maintaining intellectual depth.</content>
