# Trusted Ed25519 public keys for manifest signature verification
# Each key should be a base64-encoded Ed25519 public key (32 bytes = 44 base64 characters)
# 
# To generate a keypair:
#   - Use openssl: openssl genpkey -algorithm Ed25519 -out private.pem
#   - Extract public key and base64 encode it
#   - Or use ed25519-dalek or similar cryptographic library
#
# Example (replace with your actual public keys):
public_keys = [
    # "your-base64-encoded-ed25519-public-key-here",
    # "another-trusted-key-if-needed",
]

# URL allowlist - if specified, only URLs matching these patterns are allowed
# Supports * wildcards (e.g., "https://example.com/*")
# If empty, all URLs are allowed (unless blocked by blocklist)
url_allowlist = [
    # "https://example.com/*",
    # "https://github.com/*",
]

# URL blocklist - URLs matching these patterns are always blocked
# Supports * wildcards
# Blocklist takes precedence over allowlist
url_blocklist = [
    # "http://malicious-site.com/*",
    # "http://*.untrusted-domain.com/*",
]
