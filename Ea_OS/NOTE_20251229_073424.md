# Note - 20251229_073424

Scope: Compiler grammar/test stability fixes and contract alignment follow-through.

Changes recorded:
- Formal grammar now strips `#` comments before parsing.
- Parser prevents `rule` keywords from being consumed as statements.
- Dotted call expressions are supported (e.g., `symbiote.process_update(...)`).
- `if` statements accept labeled branches (e.g., `-> healing:`).
- Capability checker allows field access on local bindings (e.g., `healing.blob`).
- Full-spec test sources updated to avoid undeclared `referee` input.
- Verification-only test now uses a temp output path that must remain non-existent.
- AArch64 codegen test searches for epilogue bytes instead of assuming tail alignment.

Result:
- `cargo test -p muscle-compiler` now passes.
