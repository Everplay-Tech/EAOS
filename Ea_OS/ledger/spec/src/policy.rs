//! Declarative policy definitions, decisions, and alerts.
//!
//! The policy model is intentionally declarative: rules describe the shape of
//! events they apply to (scope, tags, event kinds, and origin allowlists) and
//! produce side-effect free effects (block, require justification, reroute, or
//! allow). Execution happens in `ledger_core::policy::PolicyEngine`.
