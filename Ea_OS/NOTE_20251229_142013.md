## Goal confirmation
- Goal remains: build a modular muscle-based OS with fixed-size secure blobs, strong crypto, and an embedded small LLM (phi2-class) for safe local assistance.
- Primary near-term aim: restore compile/test health so the core toolchain is reliable before expanding features.

## Priority order (current)
1) Unblock ledger transport stack (rustls/quinn/tokio-stream API drift).
2) Fix muscle-ea-pathfinder compile blockers (missing deps, wasmtime API updates, unsafe policy).
3) Fix ea-symbiote test borrow issue.
4) Align docs to v6 contract (ChaCha20-Poly1305) and remove stale AES-GCM-SIV references (done).

## Decision
- Continue with this order unless a hardware integration requirement takes precedence.
