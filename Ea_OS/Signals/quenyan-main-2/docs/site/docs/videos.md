# Video Tutorials

The following storyboard outlines the companion video series:

1. **Encoding Workflow** – Walk through `quenyan encode`, progress bars,
   and verifying packages. Demonstrates CLI plus VS Code integration.
2. **Debugging & Source Maps** – Use `quenyan inspect`, `source-map`, and
   the CLI diff tool to troubleshoot encrypted code.
3. **CI/CD Integration** – Show incremental encoding caches and the
   GitHub Action defined in `ci/github-action/action.yml`.
4. **IDE Power User** – Showcase the VS Code extension, metadata queries,
   and status bar indicator while editing morpheme streams.

Scripts and slide decks live under `docs/videos/` (to be populated) and
can be rendered using standard screen capture tooling.
