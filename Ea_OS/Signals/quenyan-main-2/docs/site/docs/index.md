# Welcome to Quenyan

Quenyan turns source code into deterministic morpheme streams that can
be compressed, encrypted, and transported safely. This documentation
site aggregates tutorials, conceptual explanations, API references, and
integration guides across the toolchain.

Use the navigation sidebar to explore the tutorial, conceptual guides,
and ecosystem integrations. The built-in search (press `/`) surfaces
keywords across the entire site.
