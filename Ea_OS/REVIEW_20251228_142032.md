# Review Notes - 20251228_142032

Scope: Verification of the newly added muscle contract spec and immediate next steps.

## Verified Artifact

- `Ea_OS/docs/muscle-contract-v6.md`

## Findings

- The blob size, layout, and invariants are consistent and explicit.
- The header is fixed at 24 bytes and used as AEAD AAD.
- The payload is fixed at 8192 bytes with a 256-byte manifest at the front.
- The crypto scheme is ChaCha20-Poly1305 with a 24-byte nonce field
  (first 12 bytes used for AEAD), plus BLAKE3 keyed derivation.
- Capability bitmap is defined and enforced by manifest/header parity.
- Optional LLM profile and organelle map are specified with explicit offsets.

## Notes

- The spec is suitable as the contract for compiler/referee alignment.
- Deterministic nonce is confined to test vectors and disallowed in production.

## Next Step

- Build a compatibility harness with deterministic vectors and wire compiler/referee
  to the `EaM6` layout defined in the contract.
